### ‚öôÔ∏è What the Code in vector.py Does

1. **Generates a simulated dataset**

   * Creates 1,000 samples with 10 features using NumPy.
   * Defines a binary classification target to demonstrate model behavior.

2. **Builds a Custom Transformer (`StatisticalFeatures`)**

   * Extracts per-row statistical summaries (mean, std, min, max).
   * Illustrates how feature engineering can uncover hidden patterns.

3. **Creates a Complete Scikit-learn Pipeline**

   * Standardizes data.
   * Trains a stacked ensemble combining:

     * Random Forest
     * Gradient Boosting
     * Logistic Regression (as a meta-learner).

4. **Evaluates Model Performance with Cross-Validation**

   * Uses `StratifiedKFold` for balanced accuracy assessment.
   * Prints mean and standard deviation of cross-validation accuracy.

5. **Applies Explainable AI (XAI)** using **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)**

   * Interprets model predictions at the meta-learner level.
   * Outputs feature importance and contribution patterns.

### üß† Learning Takeaways

1. **Pipelines are powerful abstractions.**
   They bring together preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation in a single reproducible unit.

2. **Feature engineering is often more impactful than model choice.**
   Raw data rarely reveals patterns without transformation.

3. **Stacking amplifies strengths of multiple models.**
   It reduces overfitting and generalizes better than single learners.

4. **Interpretability is not optional.**
   Explainable AI is the backbone of trustworthy and ethical ML.
