### üìò Project Overview

`Semi-supervised.py` is an **advanced demonstration of unsupervised and semi-supervised machine learning** techniques in Python.
It explores how algorithms can **extract structure, clusters, and relationships** from data even when labeled examples are limited or partially missing.

### ‚öôÔ∏è What the Code Does

1. **Generates Synthetic Data**

   * Uses `make_blobs` to create complex, overlapping distributions with 8 features and 5 centers.
   * Simulates a realistic dataset with partial labeling.

2. **Performs Feature Relevance Analysis**

   * Computes **Mutual Information (MI)** scores to quantify nonlinear dependency between features and target labels.
   * Ranks features by importance using MI.

3. **Applies Dimensionality Reduction**

   * Uses **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** to project high-dimensional data into 2D space.
   * Preserves most variance while enabling visualization.

4. **Discovers Hidden Structure**

   * Applies **DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering)** to identify natural clusters and noise points.
   * Operates without predefined cluster counts, unlike K-Means.

5. **Implements Semi-Supervised Learning**

   * Simulates partially labeled data (20% labeled).
   * Uses **Label Propagation** to infer missing labels through similarity graphs.

6. **Evaluates and Visualizes Results**

   * Computes **Adjusted Rand Index (ARI)** to compare propagated vs. true labels.
   * Visualizes PCA-transformed data colored by inferred labels.

### üéØ Significance

This project highlights the **intelligence of models that learn beyond supervision** , systems capable of inferring patterns from structure and context rather than explicit instruction.

Such methods are essential when:

* Labeled data is scarce or expensive to obtain
* The goal is **discovery**, not just prediction
* Understanding data geometry and relationships matters

It mirrors real-world situations like:

* Customer segmentation without labeled behaviors
* Fraud detection where only few fraud cases are known
* Biological data analysis (gene clustering, disease grouping)
* Semi-supervised document or image classification

### üß† Learning Takeaways

1. **Mutual Information** detects nonlinear dependencies, a more general measure than correlation.
2. **PCA** helps visualize multidimensional relationships and data geometry.
3. **DBSCAN** finds arbitrarily shaped clusters and identifies outliers automatically.
4. **Label Propagation** bridges labeled and unlabeled data for semi-supervised scenarios.
5. **Unsupervised methods** help understand data before supervised modeling begins.
